    <h1>Idiyappam (String Hoppers)</h1>
    <br>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups rice flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups hot water</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp oil (optional, for smoother dough)</li>
        <li>Grated coconut (optional, for serving)</li>
        <li>Side dishes: Stew, curry, or coconut milk (optional)</li>
    </ul>
<br>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the rice flour and salt. Gradually add the hot water while stirring continuously until the dough comes together. The dough should be soft but not sticky. If it's too dry, add a little more water.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the dough:</strong> Once the dough has cooled down enough to handle, knead it with your hands for 5-7 minutes until it's smooth and elastic. If desired, you can add 1 tsp of oil to make the dough smoother.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the Idiyappam maker:</strong> Grease the inside of the Idiyappam maker (or a sev maker) with a little oil. Fill it with the prepared dough and press it onto a greased steamer tray in a circular pattern to form the string hoppers.</li>
        <li><strong>Steam the Idiyappam:</strong> Bring water to a boil in a steamer or a large pot with a steaming rack. Once the water is boiling, place the Idiyappam trays in the steamer. Steam for 8-10 minutes or until the Idiyappam is cooked through. You should see the string hoppers holding their shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the hot Idiyappam with a side of stew, curry, or coconut milk. You can also sprinkle grated coconut on top for extra flavor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
