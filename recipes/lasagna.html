    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450g) ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>24 oz (680g) marinara sauce</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>15 oz (425g) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups (200g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (50g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fresh basil, chopped (or 1 tbsp dried basil)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the noodles:</strong> In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the meat sauce:</strong> In a large skillet, heat a bit of olive oil over medium heat. Add the ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the sauce:</strong> Stir in the marinara sauce, salt, pepper, oregano, and basil. Simmer for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the cheese mixture:</strong> In a bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan, and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong> In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Layer 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread one-third of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then sprinkle with one-third of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layering process two more times, ending with a layer of meat sauce and mozzarella on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and serve:</strong> Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with extra basil or Parmesan if desired.</li>
    </ol>
