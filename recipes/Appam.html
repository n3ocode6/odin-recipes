    <h1>Appam (Kerala-Style Pancakes)</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup raw rice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cooked rice (preferably leftover rice)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated coconut</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 to 3/4 cup water (adjust as needed)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp coconut milk (optional, for extra softness)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Soak the rice:</strong> Wash the raw rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 4-6 hours, or overnight for best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the batter:</strong> After soaking, drain the rice and grind it along with cooked rice and grated coconut into a smooth batter. Add a little water if necessary to help the grinding process.</li>
        <li><strong>Activate the yeast:</strong> In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in a little warm water. Let it sit for about 10 minutes, until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine everything:</strong> Add the activated yeast mixture and salt to the rice-coconut batter and mix well. The batter should have a pourable consistency but not too runny. Add more water if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Ferment the batter:</strong> Cover the batter and allow it to ferment for 8-12 hours, or overnight, in a warm place. The batter should double in size and have a slightly sour smell, which is a sign of proper fermentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Appams:</strong> Heat an appam pan or a non-stick pan over medium heat. Lightly grease the pan with oil or butter. Pour a ladleful of batter into the center of the pan, then tilt and swirl the pan to spread the batter into a thin layer around the edges, leaving the center thicker.</li>
        <li><strong>Cover and cook:</strong> Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the edges become crispy and golden, and the center is cooked through. The appam should be soft in the middle and slightly crisp on the outside.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the appam hot with stew, curry, or coconut milk. Appams are best enjoyed fresh and hot!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>Appam pairs beautifully with Kerala-style vegetable stew, chicken curry, or even sweetened coconut milk. Itâ€™s a perfect dish for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!</p>
